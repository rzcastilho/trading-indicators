# Dialyzer warnings to ignore
# Add patterns for warnings that are acceptable/expected

# Common acceptable warnings in Elixir applications:
# Unknown function warnings for optional dependencies
unknown_function.*StreamData.*
unknown_function.*ExCoveralls.*

# Warnings about test modules (only in test environment)
.*_test\.ex.*

# Pattern match warnings that are intentional
.*no_return.*__struct__.*

# Guards that may appear redundant but are defensive
.*guard.*will_never_succeed.*

# Decimal library known warnings (if any)
.*Decimal.*

# OTP behavior callbacks that may not be used
.*behaviour.*unused.*
